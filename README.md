We have successfully used our **[BotBrowser](https://github.com/MiddleSchoolStudent/BotBrowser)** for extensive testing with Kasada and were able to get very good cookie without failing for a long time. The test code is [here](https://github.com/MiddleSchoolStudent/BotBrowser/blob/main/tests/tests/antibots/kasada.spec.ts).
